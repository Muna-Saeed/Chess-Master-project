### Technologies

#### Languages:
- Python
- JavaScript

#### Framework:
- Flask

#### Database:
- MySQL and SQLite

#### Tools:
- Git
- GitHub

### Alternate Technology Choices

1. **Backend Framework:**
   - **Alternative:** Django
   - **Trade-offs:** Flask provides simplicity and flexibility, while Django offers a more extensive feature set. Chose Flask for its lightweight nature and better alignment with project needs.

2. **Database:**
   - **Alternative:** PostgreSQL
   - **Trade-offs:** MongoDB allows for flexible schema design, but PostgreSQL offers strong relational capabilities. Chose MongoDB for its scalability and ease of integration with a document-oriented game structure.

### Challenge Statement

#### Challenge:
- The project aims to create an engaging Chess game where users can play against each other or an AI opponent.
- The project will not solve broader chess-related challenges such as advanced chess strategies or deep chess theory.
- The project will help chess enthusiasts and casual players looking for an interactive and enjoyable chess-playing experience.
- The project is not dependent on a specific locale and is relevant to a global audience.

### Risks

#### Technical Risks:
- **Risk:** Integrating a complex AI algorithm may impact game performance.
- **Safeguard:** Implement iterative development, focusing on optimizing AI efficiency. Conduct extensive testing.

#### Non-Technical Risks:
- **Risk:** Lack of user engagement due to a poorly designed interface.
- **Strategy:** Prioritize User interface design, conduct user testing, and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

---

### Infrastructure

#### Branching and Merging:
- Follow GitHub Flow for branching and merging, creating feature branches for development and pull requests for code review.

#### Deployment Strategy:
- Utilize Fabric, a Python library, to streamline SSH-based tasks and deploy the game on remote servers. Execute deployment commands locally or remotely, with Fabric managing network connections. This approach offers flexibility for executing commands on servers maintained by the development team rather than relying on a cloud platform. The deployment will involve tasks such as uploading files, executing commands, and managing configurations using Fabric for efficient application deployment and systems administration.

#### Data Population:
- Use seed data for initial testing and development. Allow users to create accounts and save game progress.

#### Testing Tools:
- Implement unit testing using Jest for frontend and Pytest for backend. Conduct manual testing for user interaction scenarios.
